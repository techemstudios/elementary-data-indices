# Elementary Data Indices
## Code Em Assignment - Middle Intermediate

Read through the comments in the code. The solution can be done in a
single function.

## Git Process

 * If you are new to Git, review [this](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
 * Do your work on the `solution` branch.
 * Commit and push to the `solution` branch as much as you want -- as much as needed.
 * To _submit_ your assignment will be to create a PR (Pull Request) in your repo from `solution` to `master`. This will signal us that your assignment is ready for review.
 * Use the slack channel if you have any issues or questions -- definitely seek help if you don't understand Git or the PR process for submission.

## Minimum Requirements

* Complete the add_contact(contact) function (line 47).
* The included contacts and print statements should work.

## Additional Requirements (think extra credit)

* Extra credit, create a separate unittest file to test your function.
* Also, you should be able to explain what is happening, why it is
  important and what technologies actually use this approach.
